Trick17 - is a little utility for MS-Windows x64 Systems.
Purpose: Tweaking Windows Explorer, Registry, the quick and dirty way.
Toolchain: You need MS-Visual Studio 2013 Update 3 (Express will not work, because mfc is needed)
Why not Crossplatform: Its a Windows native tweaking utility, thats why.
